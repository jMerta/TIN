##End of term project for programming course


I've created this as end of term project for programming course in second semester of university using php, bootstrap and mysql database.
It is not intended to be complex, polished project but only a way to show that I know the basics of php language.


I've done it almost year ago and I did'nt know git back then. I've recently found this and decided to share as example of my php knowledge. I'm not going to refactor it at least for now. I want to use this as some kind of reference to past to see how I progressed as software developer.
